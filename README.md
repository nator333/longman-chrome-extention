## About
Search the definitions of one selected word from Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (5th edition)
Show bubble type popup for selected word's detail in Longman dictionary.

This can show clickable icon for the popup in the site whose lang property of <html> tag includes "en". And also it displays bubble immediately.
The pronunciation always adopts American English rather than British one. The option value isn't shared across the cloud.

For your information, this extension uses [Pearson Dictionary API](http://developer.pearson.com/apis/dictionaries). It's supposed to become unavailable in the end of 2017 but still available at this publication day, so this app uses until its end.
